## Introduction
Hard2Do is a to-do list software designed for the users who have the need to manage his to-do list by simply typing on keyboard and enter command.

## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

0. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given
   in the prerequisites above)
2. Click `File` > `Import`
3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
5. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

## Design

### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initialing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of Event Driven design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : Presents the UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : Distribute the commands from the user.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800">

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskManagerChangedEvent` when the Task Manager data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>
<img src="images/SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800">

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>

 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command, this results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>
<img src="images/DeleteTaskSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>

### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the Task Manager data.
* Exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* Saves `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* Saves the task manager data in xml format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `*.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Detected critical problem which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Detected problem, the program will continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Show the information of the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Show the information of the actions by the app which may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file
(default: `config.json`):


## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**Tests using Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests
  as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Tests using Gradle**:

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI.
   These are in the `guitests` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `hard2do.taskmanager.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `hard2do.taskmanager.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as
      how they are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `hard2do.taskmanager.logic.LogicManagerTest`

**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the headless mode.
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
    and upload the JAR file you created.

### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Task Manager depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

## 2 About Hard2Do

  >Are you tired of having too many tasks on your mind and constantly being frustrated of not having an avenue to list them down? Fret not because Hard2Do is here to save you from all your daily migraines that will soon be a thing of the past.

  >Hard2Do is a personal scheduler that enables you to manage your daily tasks in an easy and flexible manner. It will keep your added tasks in order and remind you when the deadline is approaching. Unlike other task managers that you have encountered before, instead of being inconvenienced by the use of a mouse, all it takes is just a single line of command to get things done. No longer will you have to be burdened by the use of a mouse as everything can be done just on the keyboard itself! Furthermore, this is just the beginning of the multitude of functions that Hard2Do is able to perform.

6. Refer to the [Features](#4-features-) section below for details of each command.<br>


## 4 Features <br>
In the guide below, we will showcase how to execute the various features that `Hard2Do` has.
> **Command Format**
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.
> * Items in `SQUARE_BRACKETS` are optional.
> * Items with `...` after them can have multiple instances.
> * Not all orders of parameters are fixed.

### 4.1 Adding tasks : `add`
*4.1.1 Add a floating task to `Hard2Do`* <br>
Adds a task without any date or time <br>
Format: `add TASKDETAILS` <br>

Examples:
* `add Have a bbq` <br>
Adds a task "Have a bbq" with no date or time
* `add Do CS2103 tutorial` <br>
Adds a task "Do CS2103 tutorial" with no date or time

*4.1.2 Add a task with date and time to `Hard2Do`* <br>
Adds a task with date and time <br>
Format: `add TASKDETAILS sd/DD-MM-YYYY ed/DD-MM-YYYY st/HH:MM et/HH:MM #TAGNAME...` <br>
> * The `presence and order` of arguments after `TASKDETAILS` do not matter except end time and dates `cannot be added` without a start time or date.
> * The format of time is `24 hours`. e.g. `19:15`
> * The days and months of dates added can be a single number. e.g. `sd/22-6-2016` or `ed/2-6-2016`
> * `sd/` takes in the start date, `ed/` takes in the end date, `st/` takes in the start time and `et/` takes in the end time.
> * `#` takes in the tags assigned to that task and multiple tags can be added.
> * Time inputted cannot be represented by a single digit. e.g. ~~`9:30`~~
> * Default time for task if time is not specified is `00:00`.

Examples:
* `add Go to CS tutorial sd/10-6-2016 st/12:00 #takethelaptop` <br>
Adds a task "Go to CS tutorial" with a start date of "10-6-2016" and start time of "12:00" with the tag "takethelaptop"
* `add Eat dinner sd/7-10-2016 st/19:00 et/20:00 #hungry #nomoney` <br>
Adds a task "Eat dinner" with a start date "7-10-2016", start time of "19:00" and end time of "20:00" with the tags "hungry" and "nomoney"
* `add Go for night cycling sd/1-7-2016 ed/2-7-2016 st/22:00 et/04:00 #tiring` <br>
Adds a task "Go for night cycling" with a start date "1-7-2016", end date "2-7-2016", start time "22:00" and end time of "04:00" with the tag "tiring"
* `add Watch movie st/20:01 #gotmoney` <br>
Adds a task "Watch movie" with start time "20:01" with the tag "gotmoney"
