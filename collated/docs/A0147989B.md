### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* Saves `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* Saves the task manager data in xml format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `*.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Detected critical problem which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Detected problem, the program will continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Show the information of the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Show the information of the actions by the app which may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file
(default: `config.json`):


## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**Tests using Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests
  as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Tests using Gradle**:

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI.
   These are in the `guitests` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `hard2do.taskmanager.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `hard2do.taskmanager.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as
      how they are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `hard2do.taskmanager.logic.LogicManagerTest`

**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the headless mode.
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
    and upload the JAR file you created.

### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Task Manager depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

Examples:
* `important 2` <br>
Changes the priority of the 2nd task to important
* `list` <br>
`important 3` <br>
